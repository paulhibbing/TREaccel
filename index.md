## TREaccel

Thanks for your interest in sample R code for running our accelerometer method for time restricted eating trials. Before moving forward with any other code, you need to (once only) run the [setup code](setup.md).

Coding is hard, and we want this resource to make it easier. If it's not working for you, please let us know by [filing an issue](https://github.com/paulhibbing/TREaccel/issues/new/choose). This is a convenient way for us to discuss what's not working and find a way to fix it.

Good luck!
